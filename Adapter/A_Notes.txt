The Adapter pattern falls under Structural Pattern of Gang of Four (GOF) Design Patterns in .Net. The Adapter pattern allows a system to use 
classes of another system that is incompatible with it. 

It is especially used for toolkits and libraries. In this article, I would like share what is adapter pattern and how is it work?

What is Adapter Pattern
Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This pattern involves a single class called adapter which 
is responsible for communication between two independent or incompatible interfaces.

For Example: A card reader acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop. You plugins the memory card 
into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read via laptop.
