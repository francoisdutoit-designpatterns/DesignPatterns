Strategy : Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

 Strategy. Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.

 Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the 
 algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
